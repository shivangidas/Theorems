# No Free Lunch Theorem

No functions/algorithms are best at everything given all conditions stay the same.
There can be infinetely many explainations for given data and it's impossible to differenciate and say this is the best.

(So we make assumptions about the dataset; different algorithms make different assumptions. Assumptions is our knowledge about the data.)
