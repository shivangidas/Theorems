# Mackay Plot

Following Occams razor, or (keep-it-simple), we try to balance the complexity of models. Deciding if a model is simple is a matter of perspective. A model that explains or has a probability for all data (M3) may be considered complex but what it actually does could be assigning uniform probability to all. M1 on the other hand can explain little data but has more surety about things. We try to find an intermidiate M2 that balances the two.
